# SCADA-SYSTEM-SURVEY
**INTRODUCTION:** SCADA stands for supervisory control and data acquisition. SCADA system is not a 
specific technology, but a type of application. Any application that gets operating data 
about a system in order to control and optimize that system is a SCADA application. That 
application may be a petrochemical distillation process, a water filtration system, a 
pipeline compressor, or just about anything else For continuous operations we have to 
provide uninterrupted power supply to the industries.
